# Gif Generator

__This application utilizes the GIPHY API to allow users to generate gifs based on a specified topic.__ 

* The application initially provides pre-built buttons with topics for the user to use.

* Users also have the opportunity to create their own button to generate gifs from topics of their choosing.<br>Users can enter their topic into the input and upon clicking submit, the application adds the user-created topic to the existing group of topics.

* If the user clicks 'Top Trending Gifs,' the app will return the top 10 trending gifs from the Giphy API.

* When the user clicks on a topic, the page grabs 10 gif images related to that topic and their corresponding ratings from the GIPHY API and places them on the page. Each gif image will stop or resume playing upon the user's click. It also provides a 'Load More' option to allow users to retrieve more gifs from the specified topic.

* Every time the user clicks 'Random Gif', the app will return a single random gif.
