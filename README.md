# Gif Generator

This application utilizes the GIPHY API to allow users to generate gifs based on a specified topic. 
* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grabs 10 gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.
* Users also have the opportunity to create their own button to generate gifs of their choosing.
